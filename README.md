# Project 2: Trolley Turmoil

## Project Goal

The user will be able to play the game of the trolley problem in which you must choose to either let the track run over the first item therefore killing or destorying it, or chose to pull the level and chose the second option which will present you with a moral dilemma.This will keep repeating until you feel your grasp of morally charged situations becomes quicker and eaiser to identify

Future feature: user choices will be visible by the user for past experiences and keep record of all other user choices have made.

The application will be using the Heroku REST API

## User Story

```
AS A user of morality
I WANT to train and reinforce my ideal scenarios by being prompted continuously
SO THAT I can make better choices for the future
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
WHEN I open the web application
THEN I am provided with a login page
WHEN I login using seeded data
THEN I am presented with a homepage that shows me how to play and start the game
WHEN I want to register my own username
THEN I present with a form for username, email, and password
WHEN I check what my profile has
THEN I can add more of my own dilemmas and look at ones I've already made
WHEN I play the game by clicking a choice
THEN I am presented with my choice being not able to change it
WHEN I log out of the app
THEN I am brought back to the login screen
```

## Features

---

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

Basic layout consists of our search form and a google map side by side. Below that, we have our Venue List and Nutrition Information listed in table format. This is done VIA keyword search.

![The Portfolio webpage includes a navigation bar, a header profile image, an "About Me", "My Works", and a "Contact Me" section. Each section includes text and images.](./Assets/images/capture6.png)

---

When a user clicks on the button associated with the Venue of their choice, a modal will present itself with information pertaining to that location.

The modal will indicate whether the restaurant delivery/no delivery/no-contact delivery as well as the restaurants basic information.

---

Our map, generated by google places API, will pinpoint and place map markers within the inputted zip code and meter radius. This will pin all restaurants in the area, even if it is outside of their operation hours.

When the user clicks on the map pin, a window will present itself with the restaurants name, address, and icon.

---

Each table implements an accordion button function that will allow the user to minimize the list down to hide the results. This button is displayed in a yellow color.
